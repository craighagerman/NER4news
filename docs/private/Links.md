## Bert based NER

- [A Primer in BERTology: What We Know About How BERT Works ](https://direct.mit.edu/tacl/article/doi/10.1162/tacl_a_00349/96482/A-Primer-in-BERTology-What-We-Know-About-How-BERT)

> Out-of-the-box BERT is surprisingly brittle to named entity replacements: For example, replacing names in the coreference task changes 85% of predictions (Balasubramanian et al., 2020). This suggests that the model does not actually form a generic idea of named entities, although its F1 scores on NER probing tasks are high (Tenney et al., 2019a). Broscheit (2019) finds that fine-tuning BERT on Wikipedia entity linking “teaches” it additional entity knowledge, which would suggest that it did not absorb all the relevant entity information during pre-training on Wikipedia.
